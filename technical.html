		<h3>Arduino Plant Working</h3>
		
		<p>At the heart of the project is a soil moisture sensor. The soil moisture sensor consists of 
		two electrodes. When the soil is dry, there is no or very little conduction of electrons through 
		the soil. One electrode is connected to +5 volts through a 10 KOhm pull-up resistor. The other electrode 
		is connected to ground. When there is no conduction through the dry soil, the current through the 10 Kohm 
		resistor is zero and the voltage drop across the 10 Kohm resistor is zero. Therefore the voltage 
		at the positive electrode is +5 volts.
		Now consider that the soil moisture sensor is in wet soil. Now there is conduction of 
		electrons between the two electrodes. The wet soil acts like a resistor. The circuit with 10 KOhm 
		resistor and soil moisture resistor acts like a voltage divider circuit. The voltage on the positive 
		electrode drops.</p>

		<p>The positive electrode is connected to the analog input on the arduino. At zero volt analog input, 
		the arduino reads zero and at +5 volt analog input, the arduino reads 1023. For any voltage in between, 
		the ardiono reads in between zero and 1023.</p>
		
		<p>When the soil sample is dry, there is no soil current conduction and therefore the positve electrode 
		remains close to 5 volts and high analog input, close to 1023 is expected from Arduino analog read. </p>
		
		<p>When the soil sample is wet, there is soil current conduction and therefore the positve electrode 
		drops to a voltage lower than 5 volts (approximately 2.5 volts) and low analog input, close to 512 is expected.		
		We have set a value of analog read to be 800 or above to be the deciding point to turn ON the arduino output to
		the motor pump. A value less than 700 indicates a wet sample and arduino output to pump motor is low 
		i.e. OFF.</p>	
		
		<p>An output (pin 13) is declared on Arduino and is connected to the motor driver, MX1616H. The motor driver 
		takes an input from Arduino and depending on the input, switches on the power to the 5 volt motor pump.
		It gets a power input from the power supply. The power supply is a five volt two ampere voltage regulator 
		powered by 220 volt AC mains</p>
