	    <h1>Arduino Plant</h1>
		
		<p>We have presented the Arduino self watering plant as a project for the IMS science fair.
		Our aim is to present the Arduino plant project as an enterprise i.e. a complete business 
		model from development to marketing and sales. For this purpose, we do not believe that 
		just presenting a prototype model is enough. We also need to develop a website for marketing. 
		Sales can be developed from the website through e-commerce.	The website is easy to develop 
		with some basic html code. It is also free to deploy on the github free webserver and only 
		needs a username and password. For example, the time taken to develop and deploy this website was less 
		than an hour.</p>
		
	    <p>As this project aims to turn ideas into an e-commerce business, the initial idea or prototype 
		need not be an electronics or technical project. The initial idea could be anything e.g. 
		handkercheif art or perfumes etc. Development of a website is a key landmark in turning ideas 
		into financial income.</p>
