	    <h1>Arduino Plant</h1>
		
		<p>We have presented the Arduino self watering plant as a project for the IMS science fair.
		Our aim is to present the Arduino plant project as an enterprise i.e. a complete business 
		model from development to marketing and sales. For this purpose, we do not believe that 
		just presenting a prototype model is enough. We also need to develop a website for marketing. 
		Sales can be developed from the website through e-commerce.	The website is easy to develop 
		with some basic html code. It is also free to deploy on the github free webserver and only 
		needs a username and password. For example, the time taken to develop this website was less 
		than an hour.</p>
		
	    <p>As this project aims to turn ideas into an e-commerce business, the initial idea or prototype 
		need not be an electronics or technical project. The initial idea could be anything e.g. 
		handkercheif art or perfumes etc. Development of a website is a key landmark in turning ideas 
		into financial income.</p>
		
	    <h1>About the Arduino Plant project</h1>
		
		<p>At the heart of the project is a soil moisture sensor. The soil moisture ensor consists of 
		two electrodes. When the soil is dry, there is no or very little conduction of electrons through 
		the soil. One electrode is connected to +5 volts through a 10 KOhm resistor. The other electrode 
		is connected to ground. As there is no conduction through dry soil, the electrode voltage is +5
		volts. Now consider that the soil moisture sensor is in wet soil. Now there is conduction of 
		electrons between the two electrodes. The wet soil acts like a resistor. The circuit with 10 KOhm 
		resistor and soil moisture resistor acts like a voltage divider circuit. The voltage on the positive 
		electrode drops.</p>
		
		<p>The positive electrode is connected to the analog input on the arduino. At 0 volt analog input, 
		the arduino reads 0 and at +5 volt analog input, the arduino reads 1023. For any voltage in between, 
		the ardiono reads in between 0 and 1023.
		When the soil sample is dry, there is no soil current conduction and therefore the positve electrode 
		remains close to 5 volts and high analog input, close to 1023 is expected.
		When the soil sample is wet, there is soil current conduction and therefore the positve electrode 
		drops to a voltage lower than 5 volts 9approximately 2.5 volts) and low analog input, close to 512 is expected.		
		We have set a value of analog read 800 to be the deciding point to turn ON the ardiono output to
		the motor pump. A value less than 700 indicates a wet sample and arduino output to pump motor is low 
		i.e. OFF.</p>
